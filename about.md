&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am software developer at Dealer.com in Burlington, Vermont. I recieved a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Vermont. I worked with the web team at the UVM College of Engineering, [www.uvm.edu/~cems/](http://www.uvm.edu/~cems/). I also interned at Intersil Corporation for summer 2015 as a Web Developer, helping to resposify their external site using Adobe CQ and Bootstrap, as well as developing tools in SharePoint. I have also volunteered my time to build the website for [Harvesting Happiness](http://harvestinghappiness.org) a charity oporating in Guatemala that helps bring food to those that can't afford it. I have also participated in several hack-a-thons.
